# Creating and Configuring Custom Command - internsctl
## Section A
âš¡ **Setting up man page**
- *Step 1 :* Go to the standrad location `/usr/share/man` in filesystem, where manual (man) pages of all the commands are stored and run `ls` command to list all the directories in that location.

  Here in this location several directories (eg.: man1, man2, man3....) store manual pages of several categories of commands.
  
 ```   The standard sections of the manual include:

    man1      User Commands
    man2      System Calls
    man3      C Library Functions
    man4      Devices and Special Files
    man5      File Formats and Conventions
    man6      Games et. al
    man7      Miscellanea
    man8      System Administration tools and Daemons

    Distributions customize the manual section to their specifics,
    which often include additional sections.```
