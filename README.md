## Creating and Configuring the Custom Command : `internsctl`
### Section A
âš¡ **Creating manual (man) page**
- *Step 1 :* 
  * Login as a root user by running the command `sudo -i` (If it asks for the administrative password, Enter it).
  * Now using `cd` command move into to the standrad location in filesystem : `/usr/share/man`, where manual pages of all the commands are normally stored in **nroff(1)** format.
  * Then run `ls` command to list all the directories in that location.\

    Here in this location, each man page is categorized in a specific section (directory), different directories (e.g., man1, man2, man3...) store man pages for different category of commands. See below -
   
     ```
        man1  -  User Commands
        man2  -  System Calls
        man3  -  C Library Functions
        man4  -  Devices and Special Files
        man5  -  File Formats and Conventions
        man6  -  Games et. al
        man7  -  Miscellaneous
        man8  -  System Administration tools and Daemons
     ```
     Now since **internsctl** is a **user command**, the manual page should be created and stored in `/man1` directory.
   
- *Step 2 :*
  * From the current directory, navigate to `/man1` directory using `cd /man1` command.
  * Create the source file of the man page using `nano`followed by `<File_Name>.<Section_Index>`.
    > **_<File_Name :>_** **internsctl** (The command itself)
    > **_<Section_Index :>_** **1** (For man1)
