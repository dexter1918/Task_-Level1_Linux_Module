## Creating and Configuring the Custom Command : `internsctl`
### Section A
‚ö° **1. Creating manual (man) page**
- *Step 1 :* 
  * Login as a root user by running the command `sudo -i` (If it asks for the administrative password, Enter it).
  * Now using `cd` command move into to the standrad location in filesystem : `/usr/share/man`, where manual pages of all the commands are normally stored in **nroff(1)** format.
  * Then run `ls` command to list all the directories in that location.\
  \
    <img src = "/images/img_1.png">
  
    Here in this location, each man page is categorized in a specific section (directory), different directories (e.g., man1, man2, man3...) store man pages for different category of commands. See below -
   
     ```
        man1  -  User Commands
        man2  -  System Calls
        man3  -  C Library Functions
        man4  -  Devices and Special Files
        man5  -  File Formats and Conventions
        man6  -  Games et. al
        man7  -  Miscellaneous
        man8  -  System Administration tools and Daemons
     ```
     Now since **internsctl** is a **user command**, we will create and store the manual page file in `/man1` directory.
   
- *Step 2 :*
  * From the current directory, navigate to `/man1` directory using `cd man1` command.
  * Create the source file of the man page using the command `touch` followed by `<File_Name>.<Section_Index>`.

    > File_Name : The command whose manual page to be created.\
    > Section_Index : For man1 - it'll be **1**, For man2 - it'll be **2**, and so on.
    >
    > In this case it will be : **touch internsctl.1**

- *Step 3 :*    
  * Now run `nano internsctl.1` to edit the source file in nano text editor. Copy and paste the following script into the source file or write it from yourself and save it.
    ```

‚ö° **2. Creating function to display the help text through the command `internsctl --help`** 

   * Create a file `internsctl` in `/bin` directory.
   * Copy and paste the following code into that file and save it.
    
      ```
      getHelp () {
	     cat /usr/bin/helpPage.txt
      }
      ```
   * Now create another file `helpPage.txt` in the same directory and copy and paste the following help text into that file and save it.
    
      ```
      Usage: 'internsctl cpu getinfo' -> Get cpu information of the local server.
       	     'internsctl memory getinfo' -> Get memory information of the local server.
             'internsctl user create <username>' -> Create a new user on the local server.
             'internsctl user list' -> List all the regular users present on the local server.
             'internsctl user list' --sudo-only' -> List all the users with sudo permissions on the local server.
             'internsctl file getinfo <file-name>' -> Get information about a file.
             'internsctl file getinfo [options] <file-name>' -> Get specific information about a file.

      Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
       --size, -s			print file size
       --permissions, -p		print file permissions
       --owner, -o			print file owner
       --last-modified, -m		print last modified date and time of the file

       --help     			display help text and exit
       --version  			output version information and exit

      Exit status:
        0  if OK,
        1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
        2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).
      ```
   * Follwing is the output of `internsctl --help`.\

#
    
‚ö° **3. Creating function to display version of the command through `internsctl --version`**

   * Add the following code into the file `internsctl` present in `/bin` folder and save it.
      
      ```
      getVersionInfo () {
	     echo "internsctl 0.1.0"
	     echo "Copyright (C) 2020 XenonStack Software Foundation, Inc."
	     echo "This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it."
	     echo "There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law."
	     printf "\nWritten by Sk. Salman Haider.\n"
      }
      ```
   * Follwing is the output of `internsctl --version`.\
