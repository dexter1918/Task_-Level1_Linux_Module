## Creating and Configuring the Custom Command : `internsctl`
### Section A
âš¡ **Creating manual (man) page**
- *Step 1 :* 
  * Login as a root user by running the command `sudo -i` (If it asks for the administrative password, Enter it)
  * Now using `cd` command move into to the standrad location in filesystem : `/usr/share/man`, where manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format.
  * Then run `ls` command to list all the directories in that location.

  Here in this location, several directories (e.g., man1, man2, man3...) store manual pages for different categories of commands as executable file. See below -
  
   ```
   The standard sections of the manual include:

      man1  -  User Commands
      man2  -  System Calls
      man3  -  C Library Functions
      man4  -  Devices and Special Files
      man5  -  File Formats and Conventions
      man6  -  Games et. al
      man7  -  Miscellaneous
      man8  -  System Administration tools and Daemons
   ```
   Now since `internsctl` is a `User Command`, the manual page should be created and stored in `man1` directory.
